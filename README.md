### Introduction



### Problem Statement

## Data Information

The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (specifically Invasive Ductal Carcinoma) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50  x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive).

Each patch’s file name is of the format:

u_xX_yY_classC.png   — > example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png

Where u is the patient ID (10253_idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and class indicates where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.
